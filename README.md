# French-Wordle-Game
Welcome to the French Wordle Game project, a collaborative endeavor aimed at replicating the engaging experience of the popular Wordle Game. Developed in collaboration with two colleagues, this project utilizes a combination of Java, JavaFX, and Python to craft the game from the ground up.

## Introduction
Firstly, when you enter the application there is a menu to choose from what game you would like to play. For now, we have just implemented the Wordle Game.

## Rules
In the Wordle Game you need to find the word that is randomly generated by the application. 
* You have to guess the Wordle in six goes or less.
* Every word you enter must exist in real life.
* A correct letter turns green.
* A correct letter in the wrong place turns yellow.
* A wrong letter turns red.

## Features
  * Guessing the Word: Players can type the word using their keyboard or click on the letters provided on the interface to form the word they believe is the correct answer.

  * Time Tracking: The game tracks the time taken by the player to guess the word accurately. This adds a competitive element to the gameplay.

  *  Increasing Difficulty: After successfully guessing a word, the difficulty level increases. For instance, if the player correctly guesses a 3-letter word, the next word to be guessed will be 4 letters long, and so on.
## Correct Word
Everytime we start a new game, there is a clock that counts down how long it takes for us to find the correct word.
